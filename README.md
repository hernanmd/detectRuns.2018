# Introduction

ROH Detection Workflow with detectRUNS R package

# Installation

  - [PLINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I62fp9HB0kg&feature=youtu.be)
  - Open a GitBash or Terminal console.
  - cd to your working directory (example: my_working_dir): ```cd /c/Users/MyUsername/Documents/my_working_dir```
  - ```git clone https://github.com/hernanmd/detectRuns.2018.git; cd detectRuns.2018/src```
  - Put your .PED/.MAP or multiple .PED/.MAP files into the src directory
    - (Optional) If your PED/MAP has many chromosomes and you want to analyze separately: PLINK can split using the --chr parameter: ```for c in $(seq 1 29); do plink --file my_input --out my_input_chr$c --chr $c --recode tab --cow; done```

# Description

See the [detectRUNS tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/detectRUNS/vignettes/detectRUNS.vignette.html) for documentation.

# Input files

  - (Optional) Check your .PED file is separated by spaces. Two ways of delimit a PED file to spaces:
    - ```tr '\t' ' ' < pedmaps/my_ped_tab.ped > pedmaps/my_ped_spaced.ped```
    - ```plink --file my_input --out my_input.out --cow --recode spacex --chr 1-29```

# Usage

  - Edit *input_params.R* with any text editor.
  - Execute from R-Studio or from command line:

Consecutive Runs of homozygosity (Marras et al. 2015, Animal Genetics 46(2):110-121)
```bash
Rscript run_dR_cr_ROHom.R
```

Consecutive Runs of heterozygosity (Marras et al. 2015, Animal Genetics 46(2):110-121)
```bash
Rscript run_dR_cr_ROHet.R
```
# Changes

## Version 1.2

  - Use output directory specified in input_params.R
  - setwd to the directory where the script resides.
  - Write tableRuns output to TSV file.
  - Log console output to file.
